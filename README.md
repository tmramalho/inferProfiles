inferProfiles
=============

MLE estimation of morphogen profiles

In MATLAB folder:
* IntroducingScaling: Figure 2A: illustrating the difference in P(x|m) and P(m|x) for Bcd profiles from long vs. short embryos
* PlotCFLengthVsSession: Plot mean vs. standard deviation of cephalic furrow position in relative coordinates for all imaging sessions, where marker size reflects number of embryos in each session
* PlotCFPosErrorAndScaling: Bottom section of Fig1A and 1B, illustrating the concepts of positional error and scaling with real cephalic furrow data
